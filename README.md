# Parallel-PCA-based-method-to-do-missing-value-imputation-in-a-numerical-dataset
A C++ implementation of a parallel PCA-based method to do missing value imputation in a numerical dataset made for course INF560 at Ã‰cole Polytechnique

### About the parallelization
It was used OpenMP library to parallelize the algorithm. The attached report does a better description about the algorithm and the parallelization possibilities.

### Useful library
Eigen C++ template library was used for the SVD decomposition.
